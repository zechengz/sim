/**
 * MCP Server Connection Utilities
 * 
 * This module provides utilities for managing connections to MCP servers via Smithery:
 * - Connection testing and validation
 * - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
 * - Model discovery and capability detection
 * - Agent execution on remote servers
 * - Health monitoring and status checks
 * 
 * These utilities abstract the complexities of Smithery integration and provide
 * a clean API for the rest of the application to use when interacting with MCP servers.
