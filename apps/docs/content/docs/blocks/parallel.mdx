The Parallel block is a container block in Sim Studio that allows you to execute multiple instances of blocks concurrently.

<Callout type="info">
  Parallel blocks are container nodes that execute their contents multiple times simultaneously, unlike loops which execute sequentially.
</Callout>

## Overview

The Parallel block enables you to:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Distribute work</strong>: Process multiple items concurrently
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Speed up execution</strong>: Run independent operations simultaneously
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Handle bulk operations</strong>: Process large datasets efficiently
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Aggregate results</strong>: Collect outputs from all parallel executions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

### Parallel Type

Choose between two types of parallel execution:

<Tabs items={['Count-based', 'Collection-based']}>
  <Tab>
    Execute a fixed number of parallel instances. Use this when you need to run the same operation multiple times concurrently.
    
    ```
    Example: Run 5 parallel instances
    - Instance 1 ┐
    - Instance 2 ├─ All execute simultaneously
    - Instance 3 │
    - Instance 4 │
    - Instance 5 ┘
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Distribute a collection across parallel instances. Each instance processes one item from the collection simultaneously.
    
    ```
    Example: Process ["task1", "task2", "task3"] in parallel
    - Instance 1: Process "task1" ┐
    - Instance 2: Process "task2" ├─ All execute simultaneously
    - Instance 3: Process "task3" ┘
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to Use Parallel Blocks

### Creating a Parallel Block

1. Drag a Parallel block from the toolbar onto your canvas
2. Configure the parallel type and parameters
3. Drag a single block inside the parallel container
4. Connect the block as needed

### Accessing Results

After a parallel block completes, you can access aggregated results:

- **`<parallel.results>`**: Array of results from all parallel instances

## Example Use Cases

### Batch API Processing

<div className="mb-4 rounded-md border p-4">
  <h4 className="font-medium">Scenario: Process multiple API calls simultaneously</h4>
  <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 text-sm">
    <li>Parallel block with collection of API endpoints</li>
    <li>Inside parallel: API block calls each endpoint</li>
    <li>After parallel: Process all responses together</li>
  </ol>
</div>

### Multi-Model AI Processing

<div className="mb-4 rounded-md border p-4">
  <h4 className="font-medium">Scenario: Get responses from multiple AI models</h4>
  <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 text-sm">
    <li>Count-based parallel set to 3 instances</li>
    <li>Inside parallel: Agent configured with different model per instance</li>
    <li>After parallel: Compare and select best response</li>
  </ol>
</div>

## Advanced Features

### Result Aggregation

Results from all parallel instances are automatically collected:

```javascript
// In a Function block after the parallel
const allResults = input.parallel.results;
// Returns: [result1, result2, result3, ...]
```

### Instance Isolation

Each parallel instance runs independently:
- Separate variable scopes
- No shared state between instances
- Failures in one instance don't affect others

### Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
  Container blocks (Loops and Parallels) cannot be nested inside each other. This means:
  - You cannot place a Loop block inside a Parallel block
  - You cannot place another Parallel block inside a Parallel block
  - You cannot place any container block inside another container block
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Parallel blocks can only contain a single block. You cannot have multiple blocks connected to each other inside a parallel - only the first block would execute in that case.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  While parallel execution is faster, be mindful of:
  - API rate limits when making concurrent requests
  - Memory usage with large datasets
  - Maximum of 20 concurrent instances to prevent resource exhaustion
</Callout>

## Parallel vs Loop

Understanding when to use each:

| Feature | Parallel | Loop |
|---------|----------|------|
| Execution | Concurrent | Sequential |
| Speed | Faster for independent operations | Slower but ordered |
| Order | No guaranteed order | Maintains order |
| Use case | Independent operations | Dependent operations |
| Resource usage | Higher | Lower |

## Inputs and Outputs

<Tabs items={['Configuration', 'Variables', 'Results']}>
  <Tab>
    <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Parallel Type</strong>: Choose between 'count' or 'collection'
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Count</strong>: Number of instances to run (count-based)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collection</strong>: Array or object to distribute (collection-based)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>parallel.currentItem</strong>: Item for this instance
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>parallel.index</strong>: Instance number (0-based)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>parallel.items</strong>: Full collection (collection-based)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>parallel.results</strong>: Array of all instance results
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Access</strong>: Available in blocks after the parallel
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- **Independent operations only**: Ensure operations don't depend on each other
- **Handle rate limits**: Add delays or throttling for API-heavy workflows
- **Error handling**: Each instance should handle its own errors gracefully
