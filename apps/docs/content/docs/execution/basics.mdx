When you run a workflow in Sim Studio, the execution engine follows a systematic process to ensure blocks are executed in the correct order with proper data flow.

## Execution Flow

The execution engine runs workflows in layers, processing blocks based on their dependencies:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Validation</strong>: Ensures the workflow has a starter block with no incoming connections and all blocks are properly connected.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    <strong>Layer-based Execution</strong>: Identifies which blocks can execute next based on completed dependencies and executes them in parallel.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    <strong>Path Updates</strong>: Router and Condition blocks update the active execution path, determining which blocks execute next.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    <strong>Iteration Processing</strong>: Loop and Parallel blocks manage iterations and create virtual instances for concurrent execution.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    <strong>Result Collection</strong>: Outputs from the final blocks are collected and returned as the workflow result.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Block Types and Execution

Different block types have different execution behaviors:

## Execution Methods

Sim Studio offers multiple ways to trigger workflow execution:

### Manual Execution

Run workflows on-demand through the Sim Studio interface by clicking the "Run" button. This is perfect for:

- Testing during development
- One-off tasks
- Workflows that need human supervision

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/static/light/manual-execution-light.png"
  darkSrc="/static/dark/manual-execution-dark.png"
  alt="Manual Execution"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

### Scheduled Execution

Configure workflows to run automatically on a specified schedule:

- Set up recurring executions using cron expressions
- Define start times and frequency
- Configure timezone settings
- Set minimum and maximum execution intervals

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/static/light/scheduled-execution-light.png"
  darkSrc="/static/dark/scheduled-execution-dark.png"
  alt="Scheduled Execution"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

### API Endpoints

Each workflow can be exposed as an API endpoint:

- Get a unique URL for your workflow
- Configure authentication requirements
- Send custom inputs via POST requests
- Receive execution results as JSON responses

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/static/light/api-execution-light.png"
  darkSrc="/static/dark/api-execution-dark.png"
  alt="API Execution"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

### Webhooks

Configure workflows to execute in response to external events:

- Set up webhook triggers from third-party services
- Process incoming webhook data as workflow input
- Configure webhook security settings
- Support for specialized webhooks (GitHub, Stripe, etc.)

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/static/light/webhook-execution-light.png"
  darkSrc="/static/dark/webhook-execution-dark.png"
  alt="Webhook Execution"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

<Callout type="info">
  The execution method you choose depends on your workflow's purpose. Manual execution is great for
  development, while scheduled execution, API endpoints, and webhooks are better for production use
  cases.
</Callout>

## Execution Context

Each workflow execution maintains a context that tracks:

- **Block States**: Outputs and execution status of each block
- **Execution Path**: Active blocks based on routing decisions
- **Loop/Parallel State**: Current iterations and distribution items
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values available during execution
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed records of each block's execution

## Real-Time Monitoring

Monitor your workflow execution in real-time:

- **Active Block Highlighting**: Currently executing blocks pulse with animation
- **Live Logs**: Execution logs appear instantly in the logs panel
- **Block States**: Visual indicators show success, error, or pending states
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time for each block

These monitoring features help you understand workflow behavior and quickly identify any issues.
